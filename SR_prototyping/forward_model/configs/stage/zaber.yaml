# Zaber Motion Stage Configuration
# For sample positioning and motion blur simulation

stage:
  name: "Zaber Linear Stage"
  # Serial port for connection
  port: "/dev/tty.usbserial-A4017DXH"
  # Axis index (1-based as per Zaber convention)
  axis: 1

# Motion parameters
motion:
  # Maximum velocity in mm/s
  max_velocity_mm_s: 100.0
  # Typical sample velocity for motion blur testing
  test_velocity_mm_s: 10.0
